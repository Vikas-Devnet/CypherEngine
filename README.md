# CypherEngine
This DLL is designed to securely encrypt and decrypt strings by utilizing a combination of salting, transposing, and hashing techniques. It incorporates the AES algorithm to provide robust encryption. The process ensures that the data is protected with multiple layers of security, making it difficult to reverse-engineer or tamper with the encrypted information.
